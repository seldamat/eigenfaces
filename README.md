eigenfaces
==========

eigenfaces experiment using PCA, scipy, numpy

computes the eigenfaces and weights for a set of face images, then reconstructs the faces using an increasing number of eigenfaces.

blog post at http://wellecks.wordpress.com/2013/12/07/eigenfaces-and-forms/

the sample_gifs folder contains three gifs which shows the reconstruction process for three different people.

idea inspired by machine learning lecture material and http://jeremykun.com/2011/07/27/eigenfaces/. used the faces94 dataset found at https://github.com/j2kun/eigenfaces.
