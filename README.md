eigenfaces
==========

eigenfaces experiment using PCA, scipy, numpy

computes the eigenfaces and weights for a set of face images, then reconstructs the faces using an increasing number of eigenfaces.

idea inspired by machine learning lecture material and http://jeremykun.com/2011/07/27/eigenfaces/
